okay so this wont be as simple as i thought. i wanted to map from x to y but it turns out that case isnt even so popular. here are the dials to eventually take as arguements:
- problem type: classification, binary classification, 
- num in, num out

fixed:
- must be supervised
- must be all numbers to use universal dataset (auto-tokenizing or something is wack)
- 1d data and not spacial data
