# multiuse_model1

task: create a program that gives anyone with a viable csv and problem access to a neural net. just give the csv and some details about the problem / data, and the program will design a model fit for your problem. then, it will demo the model for you at the end. eventually, it will also spit out a folder containing the program to run to start up your model again, and the saved model to load into the program.

progress: have basic model, brainstorming further steps
